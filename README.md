# 📊 Descriptive Statistics

A collection of Python projects exploring descriptive statistics fundamentals using real-world datasets. Part of my journey through Codecademy's Fundamental Math for Data Science course.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Analyzing categorical data distributions
- Computing measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Understanding data spread through variance and standard deviation
- Data visualization with matplotlib

## 🗂️ Project Structure
Categorical Data/
├─ *.csv, *.py – Frequency analysis and categorical distributions
Central Tendency/
├─ *.csv, *.py – Mean, median, mode calculations with real datasets
Spread/
├─ *.py – Variance, standard deviation, and data dispersion

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

# Run examples
python "Central Tendency/Apartment_prices.py"
🔧 Technologies

Python 3.x
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

📈 Next Steps
Moving on to probability theory and inferential statistics as part of my 12-month AI/ML learning roadmap.
