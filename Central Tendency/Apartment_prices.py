#11. The price for the apartments is the most in Manhattan, and the least in Queens.

#12. The data is centered around the averages of each borough as the median, mode, and mean are not that spaced from one another.
# While the mode is not the most important indicator of centrality, the fact that mean, median, and mode are within a few hundred dollars for each borough indicates the data is centered around:
#
# $3,300 for Brooklyn
# $3,900 for Manhattan
# $2,300 for Queens

#13. The histograms of each borough shows how close the mean, medians, and modes are of each other, basically, in one observation bar.
